Project Almanac: A News-Almanac Hybrid
Abstract:
Our website is designed to provide the user with information correlating certain locations (much like an almanac) but do so while also giving more “live” information like current news in the area, the weather, what time the sun will set on a given day, etc. We plan on presenting this in a newspaper format (like NYT) with horoscopes, poems, and maybe a crossword puzzle.
