## Project Almanac: A News-Almanac Hybrid

### Abstract:
Our website is designed to provide the user with information correlating certain locations (much like an almanac) but do so while also giving more “live” information like current news in the area, the weather, what time the sun will set on a given day, etc. We plan on presenting this in a newspaper format (like NYT) with horoscopes, poems, and maybe a crossword puzzle.

### How To Procure Your Own API Keys:
Our project utilizes various APIs, so the user needs a json file with the API keys formatted as such (the skeleton is provided under `keys.json`):

```
{
"newsapi":"xxxxxxxxx",
"darksky":"xxxxxxxxx",
"calendarindex":"xxxxxxxxx",
"nasa":"xxxxxxxxx"
}
```
This will be elaborated upon in the instructions. Just fetch your API keys for now.


All of the APIs we used are hyperlinked in the table below with a brief description. The hyperlinks should be sufficient to get the user started on procuring API keys. Please note that not all of the apis need keys.

api | description
--- | ---
[calendar index](https://www.calendarindex.com/)  | Gives dates of holidays and observances
[sunrise-sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) | Provides time for sunrise, high noon, and sunset
[darksky](https://darksky.net/dev) | To get the past, current, and future weather at a location
[ipapi](https://ipapi.co/)  | To get the information about location based on ip address
[horoscope-api](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Horoscope-API) | To get the daily, weekly, monthly horoscope
[newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) | To get the news or anything
[poemist](https://poemist.github.io/poemist-apidoc/#misc-services) | Get a random poem
[nasa-api](https://api.nasa.gov/) | Used to fetch a picture of location based on long/lat
